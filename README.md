# methinks
Compare genetic algorithm with and without crossover with a hillclimber 
Plot 'number of fitness evaluations to find a solution' vs 'population size'.
Vary odds of mutation to see how this affects solution time.

The target is a string.

Methinks from command line with git for portfolio

TODO:
- Should it measure evaluations or generations or both and plot six lines per graph?
- Clone tqdm for Colab version for progress bar 



Done:
- Put notebook into single file - done
- add if name = main part - done
- add click library user input when program runs - not necessary because input() does the job
- Can it plot the graph when run this way does it need the jupyter notebook to make the graph? - Yes, it plots a graph as output
